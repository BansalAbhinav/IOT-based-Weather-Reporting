The project aimed to develop an IoT-based weather reporting system using 
NodeMCU ESP8266 and Blynk. It incorporated sensors like DHT11, Rain Sensor 
Module, and BMP180 for temperature, humidity, precipitation, and barometric 
pressure measurements. The methodology involved deploying these sensors in 
various locations and wirelessly transmitting the data to a central system. Blynk 
was used for data processing and visualization, providing a user-friendly 
interface.

Overall, the IoT-based weather reporting system using NodeMCU ESP8266, 
Blynk, and sensors offers potential for advanced and accurate weather monitoring 
systems, with scope for further improvements and expansions.
